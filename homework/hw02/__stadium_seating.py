Starting Out with Python, Chapter 3, Programming Exercises #8 (page 115)

8. There are three seating categories at a stadium.  For a softball game,
Class A seats cost $15, Class B seats cost $12, and Class C seats cost $9.
Write a program that asks how many tickets for each class of seats were sold,
and then displays the amount of income generated from ticket sales.

For this exercise:
* create a function called display_total_cost; it should take three arguments:
  the number of class A, B, and C tickets sold
* the function should calculate the total cost of all of the tickets and
  display the value
* create a function called main; the main function will take no parameters
* the main function will ask for input and call the display_total_cost function 
  that you created
  
Example Output - Everything after the greater than sign (>) is user input:

Hi.  Let's see how much money the softball game made!
==========

How many Class A tickets ($15) were sold?
> 10
How many Class B tickets ($12) were sold?
> 10
How many Class C tickets ($9) were sold?
> 10
The total income is: $360!
