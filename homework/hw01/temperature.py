=====
Write a program that calculates celsius to fahrenheit based on user input.
1. The program should ask for the temperature
2. Find the formula for this conversion online or on page 78 of Starting Out
   with Python; implement this formula in your code
3. The program should output: c degrees celsius is f degrees fahrenheit
4. (obvs with f and c substituted with the appropriate calculated values)
5. Note that the outputs are floats!
6. You don't have to account for non-numeric input (at least... not yet!)

Example Output - Everything after the greater than sign (>) is user input:

Please enter a temperature in celsius
> 37
37 degrees celsius is 98 degrees fahrenheit
