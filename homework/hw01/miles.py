Starting Out with Python, Programming Exercises #7

7. A car’s miles-per-gallon (MPG) can be calculated with the following 
   formula: MPG = Miles driven / Gallons of gas used Write a program that 
   asks the user for the number of miles driven and the gallons of gas used. 
   It should calculate the car’s MPG and display the result.


Example Output - Everything after the greater than sign (>) is user input:

How many miles did you drive?
>20
How many gallons of gas did you use?
>2
Your car gets 10.0 miles per gallon.

Hint: how do you think you can ask two questions and retrieve two pieces of
data?
