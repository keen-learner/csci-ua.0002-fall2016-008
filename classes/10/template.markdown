	* built in modules
		* random
			* randint
			* random
		* sys
			* exit
			* version
		* math
			* sqrt
			* floor
			* ceil
		* turtle (we won't cover functions, etc from turtle, but just know that it's a module)
	* if statements
		* be careful of order of elifs
			* see fizz buzz
			* > or = to exactly
			* narrowest up top
		* remember to use elif and else
			* for example... if there's an else condition... user inputs 1, 2 or any number larger
			* print out foo, bar, baz respectively
			* if n == 1:
			*   print("foo")	
			* if n == 2:
			*   print("bar")	
   	    	* else:
			*   print("baz")
	* loops
		* while loops
			* some sort of condition
			* remember guard variable
			* best for
				* user input
				* unknown number of iterations
				* need to stop at a condition
		* for loops
			* several permutations of range
				* one argument
				* two args
				* three args
			* remember variable is anything
			* but you do not need count!
			* best for
				* known number of iterations
				* iterating over a finite, "known" sequence
		* general strategy
			* summing (same for both)
			* counting (only really for while, maybe)
			* input
			* what are you keeping track of?
				* perhaps more than one var
					* count and sum in while loop
					* input and sum?
				* remember there are variables outside
					* let's say x position
					* for ... move random number of feet
* homeworks
	* hw1
	* hw2
	* hw3
	* hw4
* handouts
	* go over initial hand out
	* go over intermediary handout
	* go over quiz 1
* about the exam again
