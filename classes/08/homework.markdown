4. tree.py
	* 4
</section>

### Gimmeh Answers!

__lyrics.py__ 

* this was ambiguous, so I mostly gave full credit 
* I expected multline string / bunch of prints / newlines
* I got concatenation, variables, etc

__mad_lib_lyrics.py__

* this was just string concatenation with variables
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Gimmeh More Answers!

__exercises.py__

* 8 was tricky (and confusing) - 2PM, 51 hours later
* add 51 to the 24 hour clock at 2... use mod

__tree.py__

* I hoped you would create your own
* your penalty for just copying mine was dealing with backslashes (how?)
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Some Meta

* received __28__ out of __34__ assignments
* (__2__ via __email__, but I won't judge!)
* the __average score__ of the submitted homeworks was __16.89__
* high was __18__
* low was __10__
* grades will be posted after office hours
* I'll get in touch with you if I'm missing your assignment, or if your score was below math.floor(average)
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Grading

* most exercises are going to be around __5 points__ (give or take a couple)
* by default, you get __2 points__ just for handing something in that has no syntax errors! (nice!)
* each additional point after that is for implementing the specified features of the program
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### How Does This Grading Thing Work? 

* our grader, Vincent and I break down the scores for each file prior to grading
* Vincent goes through all of the assignments on blackboard, as well as the assignments I forward to him via email
* he gives me a summary of scores and comments where points are taken off
* he also flags assignments that I should take a closer look at 
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### OK.  Great, So What Did _You_ Do?

* I read through Vincent's grades and comments
* I take a look at the flagged assignments (for example, he noticed that a lot people were confused by lyrics.py)
* I read all of the comments that you send me (somehow they arrive through text files)
* I run a random sampling (well, in this one, I ran all of the tree programs!)
* I always look at homework that you send me questions about
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Homework Policy

Remember the [posted homework policy](../../#homework); I'm actually following that!

* due one week after posting
* minor penalty each week it's late (up to 3 weeks)
* homework is a [quarter of your grade](../../#grading)
	* it should be an easy 25%; you have tutors and myself as resources
	* so, please, turn 'em in!
	* (btw, homework 2 is looking grim for submission rate)

</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Well, By _Following_, I Mean...

* because of the holidays...
* and because you're getting acclimated to how this class works...

I'll accept both __homework one and two without any penalties__ up through __October 4th__
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Turn In Your Homework!!! (Really)
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Some of This Stuff Is Difficult

* __ask lots of questions in class__
* work with the __tutors__
* __ask me__ questions (after class, office hours, email)
* use all of the resources available to you (the internets!)
* I definitely encourage helping each other out, but let's define what that means...
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### A Quick Work on Collaboration

* by default, the page on [academic integrity](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity) says that students are supposed to do all assignment individually, without collaboration
* I expect that everyone's aware of this
* it's a bit _rigid_, though, so I don't mind loosening it up a bit:
	* by all means, talk about concepts, syntax etc.
	* help each other debug programs!  sometimes you need a second set of eyes
	* talk through potential solutions; algorithms are hard ([let's go shopping](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002892.html))
</section>
<section markdown="block">
### Write Your Own Code!

With that said, though, __write your own code__

* don't just copy and paste code and change variable names
* from the web, your peers or tutors
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Bonus Stage

* [this](../../resources/txt/trees.txt)
* [and this](http://www.catgifpage.com/)
* K THX Anthony and Ying Ying
