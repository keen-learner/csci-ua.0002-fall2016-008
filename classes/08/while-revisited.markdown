### Sales Commission Program

{{ site.bookq }} has a program that: 

1. asks for a salesperson's number of sales and their rate
2. ...and then calculates their sales commission.

{% highlight python %}
# get a salesperson's sales and commission rate.
sales = float(input('Enter the amount of sales: '))
rate = float(input('Enter the commission rate: '))

# calculate the commission
commission = sales * rate

# display the commission
print("the commission is $" + str(commission))

### Commission for 10, Please?

Is it possible to change the code in the previous slide so that __the program requests data and calculates commissions for 10 salespersons ... WITHOUT USING A WHILE LOOP?__ &rarr;


<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
Of course!  It's tedious, but just write the code 10 times!

{% highlight python %}
sales = float(input('Enter the amount of sales: '))
rate = float(input('Enter the commission rate: '))
commission = sales * rate
print("the commission is $" + str(commission))

sales = float(input('Enter the amount of sales: '))

### What About Counting?

__Can you write a program to count from 1 to 5 by printing out each number on a new line WITHOUT USING A LOOP (we saw this last week)__ &rarr;

### Continue? (Yes/No)

__WITHOUT USING A WHILE LOOP, is it possible to write a program that:__ &rarr;

* asks a user if they want to continue
* if they say yes, the program will ask them if they want to continue again
* this goes on until they don't say Yes

{% highlight python %}
Continue? (Yes keeps on going)

Continue? (Yes keeps on going)
> Yes
Continue? (Yes keeps on going)

<section markdown="block">
### Continue? (Yes/No)

We could try using consecutive nested if statements, __but we don't know how deep the nesting could go__. 

{% highlight python %}
answer = input('Continue? (Yes keeps on going) \n')

if answer == 'Yes':
	answer = input('Continue? (Yes keeps on going) \n')

### Functions!?

* There's actually a way to do this using a function definition that calls itself.

## Loops Will Make All of Those Previous Programs _Easier_ to Write!

<aside>Let's talk about loops a bit...</aside>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Iteration and Loops

Some formal definitions:

* __iteration__ - repeated execution of a set of programming statements
* __loop__ (or a _repetition structure_) - the actual __structure__ that allows repeated execution of a statement or a group of statements.  The statements are repeated either:
	* a specific number of times or ...
	* as long as a certain condition is true
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Two Types of Loops

There are two broad categories of loops:

* __condition controlled__ - condition determines number of repetitions
* __count controlled__ - loop for a specific number of times
	* (it turns out that you can simulate __count controlled loops__ in __condition controlled loops__)
* guess which one a while loops is?

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
A __while__ loop is a __condition controlled loop__.
</div>
</section>


<section markdown="block">
## While Loops
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Condition Controlled Loops

* a __condition controlled__ loop causes a set of statements to be repeated as long as a condition is true
* again, in Python, the __while__ statement allows us to write a __condition controlled loop__
* ... or more succinctly: _while a condition is true, do some stuff_
* a __while__ loop consists of two parts:
	* a condition (_a boolean expression_) that is continually tested for a True or False value
	* a block of statements to repeat

</section>

<section markdown="block">
### While Loop Logic

A flow chart representing a while loop:

</section>

<section markdown="block">
### While Loop Logic Continued

What happens if the condition is True?

<div class="incremental">

* one or more statements are executed
* condition is tested again

What happens if the condition is False?

The flow goes to the statements after the while loop
</div>

</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Compared to an If Statement

The flow chart for an if statement looks pretty similar to a while loop.  __What do you think the difference would be from the diagram showing while loop logic?__ &rarr;

* condition (keep_on_going) is true 
* print "I'm going!"

* condition (keep_on_going) is false

Loop ends after one iteration.
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### What Happened There?

* we had some state __outside__ of the loop
* __within__ the loop we mutated / changed that state to eventually get out of the condition
* consequently, the loop _terminates_
* sometimes we call these kinds of variables __sentinel__ variables
* they only let certain conditions in!
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Affecting the Outcome of the Condition

To change the outcome of your conditional:

* maintain state 
	* declare a variable __outside__ of the loop!
* mutate that state on loop iteration 
	* change that variable __inside__ the loop!
	* this will eventually cause the conditional to fail
* examples:
	* using operators to change a variable in your condition
	* using input to change a variable in your condition

## Some Practical While Loop Examples
</section>

<section markdown="block">
###  Handling Input, Continue Again
First an easy one.  Let's go back to the continue program that we discussed earlier: 

* ask a user if they want to continue
* if they say yes, the program will ask them if they want to continue again
* this goes on until they don't say Yes

{% highlight python %}
Continue? (Yes keeps on going)
> Yes
Continue? (Yes keeps on going)
> Yes
Continue? (Yes keeps on going)
> No
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Continue Program, Some Questions

* what are we repeating?
* how long are we repeating it, or what's the condition to keep on repeating it?
* is there any data that we're keeping track of?
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Continue Program Implementation

{% highlight python %}
answer = input('Continue? (Yes keeps on going) \n')

while answer == 'Yes':
	answer = input('Continue? (Yes keeps on going) \n')
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that, like an if statement, variables declared outside of the body of the while loop can be accessed (and even changed) within the body of the while loop.
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Another Continue Program Implementation 

{% highlight python %}
answer = 'Yes'

while answer == 'Yes':
	answer = input('Continue? (Yes keeps on going) \n')
{% endhighlight %}

* in order to go into the while loop, just start off with something that makes the condition true!
* __what are some benefits to using this pattern?__ &rarr;

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
* we consolidate the request for input into a single point in the program
* if we want to change the question, just one place

(note that not all programs can fit this pattern)
</div>

</section>

<section markdown="block">
### A More Flexible Continue

Let's modify the previous program slightly so that it accepts either yes or yeah.

* ask a user if they want to continue
* if they say yes or yeah, the program will ask them if they want to continue again
* this goes on until they do not say Yes or Yeah

{% highlight python %}
Continue? (Yes or Yeah will keep going)
Yeah
Continue? (Yes or Yeah will keep going)
Yes
Continue? (Yes or Yeah will keep going)
Nope
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Flexible Continue Program, Some Questions

* what are we repeating?
* how long are we repeating it, or what's the condition to keep on repeating it?
* is there any data that we're keeping track of?
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Flexible Continue Program, Implementation

To implement this, modify the condition appropriately by adding _or answer == 'Yeah'_

{% highlight python %}
answer = input('Continue? (Yes or Yeah will keep going) \n')
while answer == 'Yes' or answer == 'Yeah':
	answer = input('Continue? (Yes or Yeah will keep going) \n')

<section markdown="block">
### Examples
* back to opposite yes or yeah will make it stop. answer != yes and answer != yeah ... why?
	* what result do you want this to be to make it stop? false
	* yes or yeah makes it stop ... when the input is yes or yeah, this statement should be false
	* is the same as saying not yes and not yeah makes it go
	* we briefly touched on demorgans laws
	* what has to be true about this condition?
not (x and y)  ==  (not x) or (not y)
not (x or y)   ==  (not x) and (not y)
we choose the bottom... because we said that yes or yeah made it go, now werew saying that opposite of that

## Syntactic Sugar

<section markdown="block">
### Increment / Decrement

We've used the following syntax to increment or decrement a variable

n = n - 1

_Slightly_ tedious...
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Increment / Decrement Continued

There's some _syntactic sugar_ that makes doing this less verbose:  use __+=__ or __-=__

* __n += 1__ is the same as n = n + 1
* __n -= 1__ is the same as n = n - 1

{% highlight python %}
n = 0
