* Graded exams distributed at the end of class today. 

* Please see the comments on your grade in NYU Classes for the curve and how to calculate your percentage... 
* And contact me if I've requested that you do so. Solutions will be posted this evening.

* Scores were curved
    * average and median 73%, 75%
    * 4 point (7%) curve (add that to your score, and you'll get %)
    * standard deviation ... 17%

* If the percent correct (no curve) of your 2nd midterm is 10% greater than the percent correct (no curve) of your 1st, I'll count your 2nd midterm twice. This is noted in your NYU Classes feedback.
* There's an extra credit worth 5% (5 percentage points, not actual points), on your lower midterm if you did not drop your 1st midterm score.

* The next and final Module, #10, will be due before lecture on Wednesday. I can be flexible on this date, so let me know if you need a one day extension.
* Feedback for homework #5 and #6  should be posted.

read in a dictionary (a word on every line)
for every word in dictionary
  temporarily create a list from the set of characters inputted by the user
  "tbe" --> ['t', 'b', 'e']
  for every letter in dictionary word...
    if it exists in list, then remove it from the list
    if it doesn't exist in the list...
      so it's not a word that can be formed from the characters inputted
