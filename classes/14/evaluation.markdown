### Midterm Grades

As I mentioned in the last class, I'll be posting midterm grades by the end of October.  They'll be based on:

* homeworks 1 through 5
* the first midterm

This should give you an indication of how you're doing in class, as well as areas you can improve on.

### Not Just For You

So, same goes for me.  There's also a course evaluation!

* how are the course materials? 
* how are my explanations of the topics we've covered so far?
* was the textbook useful?
* etc.

### Midterm Evaluations

1. I'll need a volunteer to deliver the evaluations to room 305 WWH
2. I'll distribute midterm course evaluations and I'll leave the room for 5 minutes
3. the volunteer will collect the completed forms
4. the volunteer will immediately bring them to room 305 of Warren Weaver Hall (the envelopes may be left under the door if it is closed)

Some info:

* Joseph Versoza
* CSCI-UA.0002
