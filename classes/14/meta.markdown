### Homework #3 Comments

* [tip.py](../../homework/hw3/tip.py), [tip.py solution](../../resources/code/hw3/tip.py) 
	* handling exactly 6 - consecutive ifs vs if / else
* [grade.py](../../homework/hw3/grade.py) 
	* if else would work to reduce code instead of using if elif (not wrong)
	* structure of conditions (if ... elif (simple condition)... rewritten as if(simple condition) else)
* [fortune.py](../../homework/hw3/fortune.py), [fortune.py solution](../../resources/code/hw3/fortune.py) 
	* to place imports at beginning of program
* [colors.py](../../homework/hw3/colors.py) 
	* different ordering of color inputs, combine using logical operators
</section>

### Homework #4 Comments

* [dice.py](../../homework/hw4/dice.py), [dice.py solution](../../resources/code/hw4/dice.py) 
	* int or integer division instead of round
	* (expected the use of round, though)
    * int always removes everything after the decimal, effectively rounding down 
* [words.py](../../homework/hw4/words.py), [words.py solution](../../resources/code/hw4/words.py)
	* multiple inputs rather than for loop
	* using for loops that only loop once, for loop with conditional for each word
* [guess.py](../../homework/hw4/guess.py), [guess.py solution](../../resources/code/hw4/guess.py)
	* loop not stopping when number was guessed
	* using two numbers that are set equal as condition (while a == 1 ...)
