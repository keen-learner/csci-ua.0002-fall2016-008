### Indexing Into a Sequence

How do we retrieve an element at a specific place from a list or a string?  For example, __to get the second element from the list a = [1, 2, 3], what code would I write? &rarr;__

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
{% highlight python %}
a[1]
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Indexes

What are some attributes of list and string __indexes__? That is... when you index into a sequence type... 

* __What date type does the index have to be? &rarr;__
* __Are list indexes sequential and consecutive, or are they unordered? &rarr;__

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
{% highlight python %}
* Indexes are ints
* They are sequential and consecutive
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Generating a Sequence of Integers

One way of iterating over every item in a list or a string is to go through each element by indexing.  

__...But how would you generate all of those indexes and go through each one? &rarr;__  

Hint: there are two ways to do this using constructs / statements that we've used before.

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
* for loop with range
* while loops
</div>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### For Loops and Indexes

__Use a for loop to print out every element in the list a = ["quill", "qat", "quip"]: &rarr;__

Some hints:

* what parameters should be passed to range?
	* what's the start index?
	* what's the last index?
* how do you access a list element?

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
{% highlight python %}
a = ["quill", "qat", "quip"]
for i in range(0, len(a)):
	print(a[i])
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### While Loops and Indexes

__Use a while loop to print out every element in the list a = ["quill", "qat", "quip"]: &rarr;__

Some hints:

* what index do you start with?
* what's the end condition?
* how do you access a list element?

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
{% highlight python %}
a = ["quill", "qat", "quip"]
i = 0
while i < len(a):
	print(a[i])
	i += 1
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### The "Usual" Way

__Finally, to round things out, use a for loop - without indexes - to print out every element in the list a = ["quill", "qat", "quip"]: &rarr;__

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
{% highlight python %}
a = ["quill", "qat", "quip"]
for word in a:
	print(word)
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Incrementing Every Element

Let's try adding one to every element in a list.

Start with the following list of numbers: numbers = [9, 19, 29, 39]

We could do something like this:

{% highlight python %}
numbers = [9, 19, 29, 39]
numbers[0] = numbers[0] + 1
numbers[1] = numbers[1] + 1
numbers[2] = numbers[2] + 1
numbers[3] = numbers[3] + 1
{% endhighlight %}

</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Incrementing Every Element Continued

But, of course, it would be better if we didn't have to manually re-assign every index explicitly. Maybe we can...

* go over every element using indexes generated by range
* increment each number by one by using assignment!

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
{% highlight python %}
numbers = [9, 19, 29, 39]
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    numbers[i] = numbers[i] + 1
print(numbers)
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</section>

### Reversing a List

__Write a function that takes a list as an input and returns the list in reverse order (btw, there's already a list method that does this) &rarr;__

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
{% highlight python %}
{% include classes/21/reverse_a_list.py %}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</section>


<section markdown="block">
### Another (More Destructive Way) to Reverse a List

__Can you use pop to do it? &rarr;__

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
{% highlight python %}
{% include classes/21/reverse_a_list_with_pop.py %}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### But Wait - What Happened?

__What's the output of the pop() version of the solution? &rarr;__

{% highlight python %}
{% include classes/21/reverse_a_list_with_pop.py %}
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
{% highlight python %}
['will', 'soon', 'disappear']
['disappear', 'soon', 'will']
[]
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Iterating with Indexes vs Regular Iteration

__How do you know which kind of loop to use when both loops (using indexes vs using elements) seem pretty similar?__ &rarr;

{% highlight python %}
for i in range(len(my_list)):

for element in my_list
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
If using an index is necessary... use the for i in range version. For example, some situations may be:

* reassigning every element in an existing list
* finding out what the previous or next element is
