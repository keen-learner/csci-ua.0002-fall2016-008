### Midterm #2

* Midterm #2 grades are posted
* We'll go over solutions at end of class
* I'll offer an additional small extra credit - 2~3 points on lower midterm exam grade (not eligible for students that scored high enough to drop their first midterm)
* I'll be reserving the last two classes for review (rather than the usual one)
