### Using Files

__How do we read information from a file?__ &rarr;

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
{% highlight python %}
in_file = open('my_file.txt', 'r')

# iterate over file object
for line in in_file:
	# do stuff

# read entire contents of file as string
contents = in_file.read()

# read entire contents of file as list
lines = in_file.readlines()

# read one line at a time (check if empty)
line = in_file.readline()

# remember to close!
in_file.close()
{% endhighlight %}

### An Exercise

You have a file called __numbers.txt__.

{% highlight python %}
Numbers
5,2
9,3
144,12
{% endhighlight %}

* extract the numbers from each line
* ignore the first line
* divide the 1st number by the 2nd number
* create a new file called __results.txt__ with the results of each calculation:

{% highlight python %}
Results
2.5
3.0
12.0
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

### An Exercise Continued

__Now modify your file to handle this input file.__

{% highlight python %}
Numbers
hello,2
9,0
144,12
{% endhighlight %}

* use __try__ / __except__ 
* there are two exceptions you'll need to handle
* __results.txt__ should contain:

{% highlight python %}
Results
not a number
divided by 0!
12.0
{% endhighlight %}
